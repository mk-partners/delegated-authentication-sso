# delegated-authentication-sso
A 100% native delegated Single Sign-On solution for Salesforce and gSuite

Before gSuite supported SSO natively with Force.com, we built our own SSO solution using Delegated Authentication and Force.com Sites.  Rather than relying on a middle layer, this solutoin is 100% native leveraging Apex Web Services and Force.com Sites.

This solution is no longer in use at MK Partners, but is being shared in case anyone can benefit from the code.
